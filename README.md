## Facial Detection System

This project is a simple prototype of building commertial facial recognition system and also collects data for CFDDB(github.com/liuwuliuyun/CFDDB).

We use *SSH* Algorithm for face detection

The SSH part of this project is modified based on the work of Najibi, Mahyar and Samangouei, Pouya and Chellappa, Rama and Davis, Larry

You can find complete SSH here https://github.com/mahyarnajibi/SSH

If you find *SSH* useful in your research please consider citing:
